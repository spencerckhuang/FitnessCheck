# FitnessCheck
Welcome to my FitnessCheck personal project! This is my first attempt at developing a mobile app. Through development, I aim to 
develop my JavaScript, React, and general software development skills. 

Fitness tracker apps are not a new phenomena, but I decided to keep the aim of my app simple as to not overwhelm myself while 
learning JS/React. The purpose of this app is to allow users to keep precise records of the exercises they perform in the gym, 
allowing for a maximum level of flexibility, such as in what workouts they choose to record, or in noting missed reps. A minimum 
viable product would include extremely basic features: the ability to start a new workout, record the sets/reps of individual exercises, 
see past training data. Some stretch goals include designing a UI that would allow for note-taking, supporting the uploading of video 
footage associated with certain sets/reps (common practice with more common, technique-demanding lifts), and more advanced data 
visualization features such as being able to display a line graph of a certain exercise over a selected period of time.

### 5/24:
I started this project a few days ago but uploaded it to GH for the first time today. I have so far continued working on the general layout 
of the application, adding necessary screens, views, and buttons.
* Added WorkoutTracker screen. This is the screen that users would see during their workout to input data about exercise/weight/sets/reps.
